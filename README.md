## Why `rosetta-iota` ?

 - [Data API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/data_api_introduction.html) to access blocks, transactions, and balances in a standard format
 - [Construction API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html) to create curve-based transactions with standardized operations in an offline execution environment
 - Stateless
