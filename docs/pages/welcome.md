# Welcome to the `rosetta-iota` documentation ðŸ“–

## Overview

`rosetta-iota` implements the Rosetta API for IOTA in Rust. If you haven't heard of the Rosetta API, you can find more information [here](https://www.rosetta-api.org).

**This documentation is `rosetta-iota` specific.** If you would like to learn more about the Rosetta API in general, please visit the following documentation:
                                                    [General Rosetta API Documentation](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html)

## Why `rosetta-iota` ?

- **Automatically** starts a pre-configured IOTA full-node
 - [Data API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/data_api_introduction.html) to access blocks, transactions, and balances in a standard format
 - [Construction API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html) to create curve-based transactions with standardized operations in an offline execution environment
 - Stateless
 - [Storage pruning](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/storage_pruning.html) for a more reliable integration and better performance
